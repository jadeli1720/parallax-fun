# Parallax-fun

The projects sole purpose is to learn how to add parallax functionality with HTML, CSS, &amp; vanilla JavaScript

Parallax-fun is based off of a tutorial provided by the YouTube channel [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers/videos/). However, I hope to test out various ways of achieving the same result, add new features using  vanilla JS, and create a fully functional/flushed-out web page in future iterations.
